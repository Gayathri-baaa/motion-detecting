Motion detection and tracking systems are widely used in surveillance, security, and automation to identify and monitor dynamic objects within a scene. This project presents a robust Motion Detection and Tracking System utilizing advanced computer vision techniques implemented in Python with OpenCV. The system captures live video feed and accurately detects motion using Background Subtraction (MOG2), coupled with noise reduction through morphological operations.

Key features of the system include:

Real-Time Motion Detection: The system identifies and isolates moving objects by dynamically differentiating between the foreground and background.
Accurate Bounding Boxes: Detected objects are enclosed in bounding boxes to visualize motion regions effectively.
Noise Filtering: Morphological transformations are applied to eliminate minor noise and refine object boundaries for enhanced accuracy.
Dynamic Object Tracking: The system uses efficient tracking algorithms to follow detected objects, ensuring continuity even with overlapping or occluded objects.
This high-accuracy motion detection and tracking system can be deployed in applications such as smart surveillance, intrusion detection, and automated traffic monitoring. Its modular design allows for easy integration with advanced tracking systems, cloud storage solutions, or IoT devices. Future enhancements could include the integration of deep learning models for object classification, region-of-interest (ROI) filtering, and event-based alerts to cater to specific user requirements.

By combining real-time detection with robust tracking, the system provides a reliable and scalable solution for motion analysis in dynamic environments.
